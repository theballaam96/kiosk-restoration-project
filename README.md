# DK64 Kiosk Restoration Project
Restoration project for the Kiosk Version of Donkey Kong 64.

## Why?

The Kiosk version of Donkey Kong 64, demonstrated in retailers in September 1999, has a lot of data missing as Rareware stripped the game of most non-vital assets. This results in most deep-dive videos of the Kiosk version of DK64 having a lack of terrain. This hack aims to restore that and return the game into a semi-playable state.
